# Ramanujan_Hardy-4-digit-numbers
# This code is applicable for 4 digit Ramanujan Hardy Numbers ( 2 ways)

## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of the Ramanujan-Hardy Number algorithm in Python. The Ramanujan-Hardy Number is a fascinating mathematical concept that was discovered by the famous Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan and studied further by G.H. Hardy. The algorithm helps to find these unique numbers, which are expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.

## Ramanujan-Hardy Number

A Ramanujan-Hardy Number, also known as a "taxicab number," is a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways:

```
n = a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3
```

where `n` is the Ramanujan-Hardy Number, and `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are positive integers. The challenge is to find such numbers and the corresponding sets of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

## Usage

The Python script `ramanujan_hardy.py` contains the implementation of the algorithm to find Ramanujan-Hardy Numbers. Upon execution, the script will display the first few Ramanujan-Hardy Numbers and their corresponding sets of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Feel free to modify the script to explore higher Ramanujan-Hardy Numbers or make any improvements to the algorithm.
